A detailed README is planned for the future. Currently the app's goal is to access a user's Reddit account and fetch specific data about their history as wekk as past interactions on the site. The fetched data will then be rendered utilizing a data visualization library or depenency (i.e. D3). 

Currently the app relies on OAuth 2.0 for authorizing the app to allow for a seamless user experience. Details and additional features will be outlined soon alongside a more detailed set of instructions.
