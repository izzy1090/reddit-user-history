<p align='center'><b>Welcome!</b></p>
<p>After granting access, you're able to view all of your subscribed subreddits, posts and past comments. I designed this to be a streamlined version of reddit without all the ads!</p>
<p>Currently there is a means of visualizing your data, however that's a work in progress.</p>
<p>Planned features:</p>
<ul style={{listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1.5em'}}>
    <li>See past subreddits you've liked</li>
    <li>Like threads, posts, or comments on Reddit directly from the app</li>
    <li>Add additional metrics visualizations (i.e. comments, likes, etc.)</li>
    <li>Sort results for each category by new or old displaying first</li>
    <li>Lazy loading for each tab</li>
</ul>
