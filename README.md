A detailed README is planned for the future. Currently the app's goal is to access a user's Reddit account and fetch specific data about their usage history on the site. Fetched data will also be visualized with a library or dependency (i.e. D3, Chart.js, etc.). 

Currently the app relies on OAuth 2.0 for authorizing the app to allow for a seamless user experience. The app also automatically fetches data re: a user's past posts, comments and subscribed subreddits.
